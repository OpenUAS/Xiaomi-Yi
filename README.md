# Xiaomi-Yi
## Xiaomi Yi R&amp;D repository

### To-do list:
- Learn basics of Python - Half understood!
- Extract Possible Autoexec commands from Firmware - Done! (Extracted from firmware 1.0.12)
- Create application/software For Win/Mac/Linux with Python:
		- Autoexec Manager	- Main idea and code written
			- Look For autoexec.ash
			- Manage the file, remove, change names, etc.
			- Find commands in it and manage them.
			- Save file and transfer it to MicroSD.
		- Firmware Manager	- Main idea and code written
			- Run AFT From program, if not downloaded could be downloaded
			- Download firmwares depending on HW version from Xiaomi Official site.
			- Check MD5
			- Rename and transfer firmware to the MicroSD
		- USB Manager		- Not started
			- Not sure about the utility as this could be done easily in any OS
		- Wifi Control		- Trying to learn how to do it, but not being easy at all!!
			- Main idea is to get something like the existing "C&amp;C" tool from Andy_S, but done by me. I don't know how much time is going to need this.
				- Until I create mine the app will launch existing "C&amp;C" tool from Andy_S
